## Objectives

1. Build out action creators that return the correct data.
2. Create actions to read, create, and destroy data.

## Instructions

In this lab, you'll be creating three different action creators that return different actions. Write your code in `actions/index` for `addMovie`, `deleteMovie`, and `fetchMovies`.

**NOTE** - we've provided you a list of movies in the `movies.js` file in the root of this directory - your `fetchMovies` action should load the data from this file. In future lessons, we'll look at how to load this data from an API.
