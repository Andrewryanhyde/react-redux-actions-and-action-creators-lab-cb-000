# Lights...Camera...Action!

This lab will have the students practice making action creators. We'll have them create two or three action creators. One will fetch a list of movies, one will create a movie, and one to destroy a movie. 

The specs should test that

1. The action creators return an object with the correct type.
2. They should return an object with the correct payload.
